# Automation Scripts
#### NOTE: Only published data have been used in this package.

This is a WIP collection of initial scripts which I developed to automate the production of a statistical publication.

- [Clean and Summarise Data](https://github.com/Marie-L/quarterly_release_y-e_sept_20/blob/main/returns_1.R)
- [Compare data](https://github.com/Marie-L/quarterly_release_y-e_sept_20/blob/main/returns_2.R)

I continued the work in python [here](https://github.com/Marie-L/PublicationScripts)
